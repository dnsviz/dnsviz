DNSViz is a tool suite for analysis and visualization of Domain Name System
(DNS) behavior.  It is used by invoking its command line utilities to obtain
and analyze DNS responses.  For example, the following command issues queries
related to the analysis of ``example.com`` and stores the responses in the file
``example.com.json``::

    $ dnsget example.com > example.com.json

The following command creates an image of the assessment of in a file called
``example.com.png''::

    $ dnsviz -Tpng -O example.com < example.com.json

This command does the same thing, but the result is in HTML and javascript for
an interactive graph.  The file is named ``example.com.html''::

    $ dnsviz -Thtml -O example.com < example.com.json

Finally, this command outputs any errors found in the analysis to standard
output::

    $ dnsgrok -l error example.com < example.com.json

Use the -h option with any of the command-line tools to print their full usage.
